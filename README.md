## About Project
This engine was suppossed to be a game. I decided to create it using many easy functions. The idea of making it an engine appeard a few days ago.
## Newest Version Info
Build 2 is very early version of the engine. For now it should be only used for private reasons.
## Usage
For now you use it by editing main.c where you can manage window and create objects. When I'll end making all basic features I will try to make it graphical. For now those plans are very far from being completed :- )
