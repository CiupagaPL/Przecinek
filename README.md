# Readme
**Warning!** This project is not ready for private use! It's still in active development.

## About Project
**This engine is designed to create simple 2D games and applications.** The idea for it came when I was working on other projects. I didn't want to use commercial engines for them as they are overbloated and hard to use. It also takes many years of experience to master such engines. And that's where the idea came from â€“ **what if I created a simple and minimal open-source engine?**

## Game Status
The project so far relies on modifying main.c to create and manage the window. Its code is small and simple. **The project slowly transforms into something bigger.**

> Newest Build 2.5 is a transitional build from version 2 to 3 of the project.

## License
**Project licence is based on GPL 3.0.** It uses some 3rd part assets that I'll list bellow. If I'll forget about something I'm really sorry! Here's the list:

- CSFML - Game engine is based on these libraries. You can find them [here](https://github.com/SFML/csfml).
- Fira Mono - It's used as main font in this project. You can find it [here](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira).

> There will also be transitional assets that I'll try to get rid of after each new build.

## Special Mention
Shout out to the people who have helped me with my previous projects!

## Have a good one!
